# Making tidy data

This `R` script reads four different `.txt` files from the two folders: train and test. You have to set the directory at the first line of the code for your working directory. 

The code performs merging, selecting, summarizing and finally spread function to write out the final result: `tidy_UCI_HAR.txt`

For information about the dataset, the transformations, and the feature names, please see the `CodeBooke.md`.
